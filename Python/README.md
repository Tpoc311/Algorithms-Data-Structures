This project divided by two parts - `lib` and `tasks`.

## lib

The `lib` directory - is a module, which contains implementation of Data Structures. You may want to test them by
importing in your own project - feel free to try!

## tasks

The `tasks` directory contains solving a bunch of problems using common algorithms and data structures (including data
structures from `lib` module).
