# Implementation of common Data Structures

Here are implementation of common data structures presented.

## Linked List

In this implementation we use two classes - `Node` and `LinkedList`.

### Node class

The `Node` class is a data class used to store each value. `Node` class has two attributes:

1. `data` - to store value of the node.
2. `next` - pointer to next node.

### LinkedList class

`LinkedList` class used to operate on each node.

Attributes:

1. `head` - pointer to first value in the list.
2. `size` - number of elements stored in the list

Methods implemented for LinkedList:
